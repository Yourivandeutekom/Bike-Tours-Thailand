<h1>Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox</h1>
<h2>Bike Tours Thailand</h2>
<p>Back in 2019 when I was in Thailand i did a tour with Co van Kessel a beautiful bicycle tour through Bangkok, if you go on holiday there please visit them. For me this was a good reason to pick this company and use it for my project for my course within CodeCademy.</p>
<h2>Project goals</h2>
<p>In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company!​</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>For this project I started with creating my design in Adobe XD. Picked my images and fonts from the internet and started building my HTML. With the usage of flexbox I managed to build my own layout for my company website. After I liked to add some JavaScript flavour.</p>
